# React TypeScript Component Library

**By Sebastian Inaba**

> A collection of React components written in TypeScript.

## About This Project

This project is a personal component library built from scratch using React and TypeScript. It serves as both a learning journey and a practical toolkit for building UI components with strong typing and clean design.

### Preview UI for Components (Future plan)

To make this library easier to use and explore, Iâ€™m going to building a dedicated **Preview UI**, a simple showcase app that renders all components live, allowing easy interaction and visual testing.

- The Preview UI will use only the components within this library, no external UI dependencies or individual code(except maybe some html and css).
- As this is a step-by-step project, the Preview UI will take a while before implemented.

### Current Progress Updates

- Fixed personal problem with file uploader component
- Added color picker component with react library 'react-color'

### Why This Project?

- To practice React + TypeScript with real component-building experience.
- To create reusable, somewhat well-typed UI components for future projects.
- To understand best practices in component architecture and documentation.
- To have a component playground.
